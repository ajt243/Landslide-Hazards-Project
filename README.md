Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing landslide hazards to provide insights into their patterns, causes, and impacts. Using NASA's Global Landslide Catalog, we explore the relationship between landslide size and fatalities, assess predictive models, and identify geographical regions at risk. Our findings aim to enhance disaster management strategies and resilience against landslides.

Data
The analysis uses data from NASA's Global Landslide Catalog, which includes landslide events worldwide from 2007 to 2019. The catalog provides detailed information on each event, such as date, location, trigger, type, and human impact.

Key Findings
Geographical Patterns: Certain regions show higher susceptibility to landslides. The study highlights areas that require focused disaster preparedness efforts.
Landslide Size and Fatalities: Larger landslides are associated with higher fatality rates. Our logistic regression model achieved a moderate predictive capability with an ROC AUC score of 0.689.
Temporal Trends: The number of small and large landslides has increased over time, while medium-sized landslides have decreased. Seasonal patterns indicate higher risks in winter and summer.
Predictive Modeling: We developed models to predict casualties based on landslide size, providing valuable insights for emergency response planning.
